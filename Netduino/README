This is a project file written for the Netduino Plus 1 microcontroller.
It is a ported version of the PC version of my hit detection algorithm.
There are a few methods that are not fleshed out, but it will compile on the Netduino Plus 1.

Things to be implemented
-------------------------
method: Main
setup pins assignment
init I2C
init display
test and init the accel

method: GetAccelData
pull data from accel

method: UpdateDisplay
print numHits to the display

method: BlinkError
blink the on-board LED in some fashion to signal an error
