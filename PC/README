This is a windows desktop project file written in Visual Studio Express 2010. 
If you have VS installed, simply execute the solution file and press F5 to run the program.
Click the Browse button and find the text data file you wish to get a hit count from.
Once you have selected the data file, click the Calculate Hit Count button.
After a moment you will see a graph that shows the filtered data, the locations in the data where hits were detected, and the Hit Count box will display the number of hits detected.
Expand the size of the window to get a better view of the graph.
